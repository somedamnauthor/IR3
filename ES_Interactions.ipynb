Her past medical history is remarkable for hypercholesterolemia and two C/sections. She has 2 children, and she is menopausal. She doesn't smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is mildly febrile. Her BP is 150/85, HR 115, RR 15, T 38.2, SpO2 98% on RA. On palpation, she experiences epigastric tenderness  and  tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for elevated ESR and leukocytosis with a left shift. The ultrasound revealed several gallstones and biliary sludge. The largest gallstone is 0.7cm. Surgery consultation recommends elective cholecystectomy.\""
