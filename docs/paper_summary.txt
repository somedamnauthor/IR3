Which BM25 do you mean? Summary:
================================

Various implementations of BM25 exist. Many variants of the scoring function.

Lucene is the version deployed in the real world

All the variants have very low difference between them in terms of retrieval precision. However Lucene is far faster in terms of retrieval time.

Two variants of Lucene are implemented in the study.
The default implementation uses an approximation of the original document lengths.
The accurate implementation does not approximate this. 
The retrieval precision difference is negligible between the two.
